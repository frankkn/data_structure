Given a sequence of  positive integers, .

It is required to support operations of 3 type:
```
Search(A, key)
```
● return 1 if key is in ; otherwise, return 0
```
Predecessor(A, key)
```
● return the largest integer being smaller than key in  if such integer exists; otherwise, return 0
```
Successor(A, key)
```
● return the smallest integer being larger than key in  if such integer exists; otherwise, return 0

There will be  queries of either type.

Each query is an ordered pair of integers: (operation id, key).

The operation ids for search, predecessor, and successor are 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

Please try your best to respond these queries correctly and efficiently.
